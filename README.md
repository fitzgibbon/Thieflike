Description
-----------

Thieflike is a minimal roguelike written to better understand the process
of writing a game in Haskell, and seperating console code from gui code. This is not meant to be a fully-featured 
roguelike, just something fun.


Usage
-----
$ cabal install    
$ Thieflike

Use 'wasd' to move around, and 'q' to quit.
